# The Nela Network

The Nela Network file custody is devided into two parts:

\
1\. A Decentralized Storage\
2\. A Decentralized Content Acceleration Network (DSCAN)

The decentralized storage is a KAD network that is optimized for the EDFS protocol, the storage supports Nela's ESeal protocol for access control.\
Users never interact directly with the decentralized storage as all access is goverened by DSCAN via standard HTTP. \
\
this unique architecture allows for simple access from any device via HTTP, and high pefromance due to caching of files, optimized routing and fast retrieval of files.\
