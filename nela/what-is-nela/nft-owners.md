# NFT Owners

At Nela, we believe that in order to ensure the longevity of NFTs and their mainstream adoption into other industries and domains beyond digital collectibles, we must address the following problems of NFT-backed assets.

<details>

<summary>Immutability</summary>

NFTs are only an ownership record system, they only maintain a link. Underlying assets must be stored off-chain. If the original file uploader can change the underlying assets (“pulling the rug”), the NFT loses its value. It is therefore crucial that the off-chain assets are immutable so that secondary owners of the NFT maintain the asset they originally purchased.

<summary><strong>Permanency</strong></summary>

NFT assets are stored off-chain, in some instances on decentralized storage and in others on centralized alternatives. In most cases, permanent storage requires the original uploader to support the storage of the file. Whatever the case may be, it is critical that NFT assets are permanently available online, losing access to an asset renders the NFT valueless.

<summary>Performance</summary>

For NFTs to gain mainstream adoption, it is crucial that their storage and delivery are comparable to that of the status quo. That means, high-speed download/upload in order to support high-performance applications such as 4K streaming, gaming and VR. Additionally infrastructure must be cater to any file type and file size.

<summary>Security &#x26; Access Control</summary>



Owners need control over who can access NFT assets and should be able to revoke access once given.

<summary>Flexible Monetization</summary>

Rentals, PPV, and limited-time rental are standard forms of licensing. Expanding NFTs to new domains requires having more than just an ownership transfer.

</details>

<summary>Digital Rights Management</summary>

Protecting assets on the end-user side is a vital aspect of content distribution. High-value content requires protection from piracy, duplication, and IP theft.
