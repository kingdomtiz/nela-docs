  <summary>###**Is Nela decentralized storage?**</summary>
  Yes and no. Nela itself is a decentralized ownership infrastructure, it comprises a set of components, some concerning file security and digital rights management and others concerning asset storage and asset delivery. Decentralized storage is only a component of Nela’s infrastructure.

### **Why are there components on the kernel layer of the operating system?**

A wide range of existing software has been designed and implemented to edit and parse a multitude of digital file formats for desktop and mobile terminals. It is unrealistic to require legacy systems and file formats to adapt in accordance to the requirements of the blockchain. To provide security for all file type and application standards, encryption and decryption must occur in the operating system.

By combining the operating system with the decentralized blockchain network, file owners can have full control over the entire life-cycle (creation, distribution, usage, and destruction) of their digital assets.

### **What value does integrating Nela into a DApp provide?**

No solution currently exists that provides the level of monetization flexibility and asset security that Nela provides. Digital asset rental is possible, adding additional revenue streams to NFT asset owners, whether time based rental, PPV, and even renting out of redistribution rights. Because the file is encrypted even during use and its access control is governed by the blockchain, digital asset owners can guarantee that access will be revoked at the end of the rental period and that plaintext can never be obtained by the end user, protecting the owner’s intellectual property from abuse.

### **What options are there for DApp developers to incorporate Nela’s functionality?**

Nela’s SDK is modular and calls to the network are HTTP based. At its most basic level, traditional websites can incorporate Nela’s access control functionality through a simple library and webpage, however they cannot guarantee full intellectual property protection, as this requires downloadable modules.

Nela’s SDK provides the Local Service module. Local Service can be incorporated straight into DApps developed using the standard webapp stack. User’s downloading these DApps will be able to use Nela’s full functionality for files accessible through the DApp.

For the full effects of IP protection, DApp developers can incorporate the DSFS (Decentralized Secure Real-Time File System) and Security Sandbox modules to provide protection at the kernel layer of the operating system. With this, users will be able to use any type of file with any native software without the ability to duplicate or abuse the asset (a .psd file can be opened with Photoshp, a .mp4 with VLC, etc).

Lastly, Nela will release the Nela Browser. A browser client with all of Nela’s modules built-in to it. User’s who access using the Nela Browser will have full access to Nela’s functionality and it will act as a portal for the DApp ecosystem

### **Is Nela’s solution only fit for NFT owners?**

No. Nela is a decentralized ownership solution and live distribution network. Sophisticated but easy-to-use monetization strategies make it a prime tool to expand what owners are able to do with their NFTs. Keeping this in mind, since Nela provides a commercial grade, high-speed decentralized storage and delivery network also makes it prime infrastructure for decentralized websites, games and general digital file delivery.
